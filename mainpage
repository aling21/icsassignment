  <p class="p1"><b>Instructions:</b></p> 
  <p class="p1">Step 1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Farenheit and grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. Set aside.</p>
  <p class="p1"> Step 2. Whisk the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Set the bowl aside.</p>
  <p class="p1"> Step 3. Melt the butter in the microwave until liquid, then mix with brown sugar in a bowl. Next, add the eggs and beat well. Then, add mashed bananas and vanilla extract until the mixture is combined. </p>
 <p class="p1"> Step 4. Slowly pour the the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and mix until combined. Do not overmix. Optional: If using, add chocolate chips and/or nuts at this stage.</p>
  <p class="p1"> Step 5. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and spread until evenly distributed. Bake for about an hour. Take the loaf out and check to see if the bread is done by inserting a toothpick into the center of the loaf. If it comes out clean with a few crumbs sticking to it, the bread is done. If the mixture is wet, the bread is not done baking yet. </p>
  <p class="p1"> Step 6. Allow the bread to cool in the pan before slicing and serving for at least 1 hour. </p>
